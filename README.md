# LuxXx' 9gag API

I implemented a restful serverless 9GAG API with AWS Lambda. It fetches a post and all corresponding information by its id.
It's currently hosted in Frankfurt. If you need a mirror somewhere else, message me (pr0v0ziert@gmx.de).

## API
The API contains the following functions

- [GET /:id]

### Resource URL

`https://4hh6cgdgxc.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/:id`

#### Sample Response
This is a sample response:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "success": true,
  "body": {
	"imageLink": "http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aWmZAPZ_700b.jpg",
	"webmLink": "http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aWmZAPZ_460svwm.webm",
	"mp4Link": "http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aWmZAPZ_460sv.mp4",
	"gifLink": "http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aWmZAPZ_460sa.gif",
	"id": "aWmZAPZ",
	"title": "Where she&#039;s travelling?",
	"animated": true,
	"nextId": "aLDK7ZP"
}
}
```

17.05.2017: 9gag switched to HTTPS some time ago, therefore I had to tweak this project a little bit

14.03.2018: 9gag changed the data structure, added `nsfw`, `upVoteCount`, and `commentsCount`

24.07.2018: Changed the type of the body of the response
